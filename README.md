# exploring-parquet

## Introduction
In this mini-project, I sought to compare the result of storing a table as a CSV file against parquet. It is well known that Parquet is a read-efficient file format that supercharges query performance for analytical use cases due to its columnar nature. By default, it uses `snappy` compression that reduces file size by more than half. Due to this compression, a slight overhead is associated with the write time of the file. Read my [blog article](https://shreyandas.hashnode.dev/parquet-vs-csv) to know more.

## Procedure
1. Set up a MySQL Server on your local machine.
2. Download all Python packages and dependencies mentioned below.
3. Download the `airportdb` Database from [MySQL's Official Pages](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html).
4. Extract the files in your preferred directory.
5. Copy all files with the extension `.zst` and place it inside a folder called `zst_folder`.
6. Run the Python script `zst_extractor.py` making appropriate changes in the source and destination folder paths.
7. Run the `tsv_to_csv_converter.py` Python Script to convert to a format readable by MySQL Server. (*This step is optional.*)
8. Run the `DDL Queries.sql` file on the MySQL Server to create the schemas for all the required tables on the `airportdb` database.
9. Set `allow_local_infile` parameter on the MySQL Server configurations to `true`.
10. Run the `Data Loader.ipynb` notebook to load all the files to the database.
11. Query the tables on the database to ensure proper data load.
12. Run the `ingestion_pipeline.py` twice, once with `write_mode='csv'` and then with `write_mode='parquet'` and changing the sink folder location for each run.
